    <i>We follow these principles:</i>
    </font>
    
    <p><font size="+2">
    Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer<br>
    through early and continuous delivery<br>
    of valuable software.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>
    
    <p><font size="+2">
    Welcome changing requirements, even late in <br>
    development. Agile processes harness change for <br>
    the customer's competitive advantage.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>

    <p><font size="+2">
    Deliver working software frequently, from a <br>
    couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a <br>
    preference to the shorter timescale.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>

    <p><font size="+2">
    Business people and developers must work <br>
    together daily throughout the project.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>

    <p><font size="+2">
    Build projects around motivated individuals. <br>
    Give them the environment and support they need, <br>
    and trust them to get the job done.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>

    <p><font size="+2">
    The most efficient and effective method of <br>
    conveying information to and within a development <br>
    team is face-to-face conversation.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>

    <p><font size="+2">
    Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>

    <p><font size="+2">
    Agile processes promote sustainable development. <br>
    The sponsors, developers, and users should be able <br>
    to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>

    <p><font size="+2">
    Continuous attention to technical excellence <br>
    and good design enhances agility.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>

    <p><font size="+2">
    Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount <br>
    of work not done--is essential.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>

    <p><font size="+2">
    The best architectures, requirements, and designs <br>
    emerge from self-organizing teams.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>

    <p><font size="+2">
    At regular intervals, the team reflects on how <br>
    to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts <br>
    its behavior accordingly.
    </font></p>
    <p style="color: red;">We do agree</p>
